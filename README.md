# Playground with Go

Personal playground where I'll be learning and experimenting with the Go language.

## Usage

```
go run main.go     
```

## Notes

In VSCode, open the Command Palette and type:
Go: /Install/Update Tools
Select all of them an click OK

If installation fails with an error like this:
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path

Install XCode command line by running this command in the Terminal:

```
xcode-select --install
```
