# Playground with Go

Personal playground where I'll be learning and experimenting with the Go language.

## Usage

```
go run main.go     
```

## Notes

In VSCode, open the Command Palette and type:<br>
"Go: Install/Update Tools"<br>
Select all checkboxes and click OK

If the installation fails with an error like this:<br>
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path

Install XCode Command Line by running this command in the Terminal:

```
xcode-select --install
```
